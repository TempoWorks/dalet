# DaletMark specification for Dalet v1.0-preview

## DaletMark

DaletMark is high level markup language for humans. DaletMark is not used for site requests. DaletPack should always be used to retrieve a site page.
It can be compiled into DaletPack, but DaletPack cannot be decompiled into DaletMark[^1]. It is only used for page creation by humans.
