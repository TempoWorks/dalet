## Concept

This is DaletMark (high level language that compiles to DaletPack).

```DaletMark
# multilines
#
# {text} - input is trimmed with indent
#
# {~n text} - n is number of minimum spaces to add after trimming with indent
# for each line
#
# {#text} - input not modified
#
#
# tag syntax
#
# tag: text body
# tag { multiline text body }
# body text always trimmed
#
# tag [ multiple tags body ]
#
# Arguments
# tag argument
#
# Tags without body and argument also supported
#
#
# custom no tag syntax
#
# {-text} - paragraph, text indent is trimmed
# [[tags]] - element tag with body of multiple tags
# text - element tag with text body

h1: TxtDot revolution
p: TxtDot is a cool project

# If no tag is specified, but "- text" present, then the 'el' tag is placed

- This is element
br

# if no tag is specified but a '{- text}' is present, then the 'p' tag is placed
# '\n' is replaced with ' ' in this format.
{-
    Check Dalet too
    This is one paragraph
}

{-
    This is another paragraph ({- text\})
}
